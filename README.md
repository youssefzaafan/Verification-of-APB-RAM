# UVM Verification of APB_RAM

## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive **UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)** environment to verify the functionality of an **APB_RAM** module. The APB_RAM module is a memory block interfaced with an **AMBA APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus)** protocol, supporting read and write operations with proper handshake and control signals.

---

## Project Description

The **APB_RAM** module serves as a synchronous memory block accessed through the APB protocol interface. It supports:
- Byte-addressable read/write operations
- Handshake signals including `PSEL`, `PENABLE`, and `PREADY`
- Error detection on protocol violations

The goal of this project is to develop a reusable, scalable UVM verification environment capable of thoroughly validating the APB_RAM design under multiple scenarios.

---

## Verification Environment Architecture

The verification environment is composed of the following components:

- **Agent**: Encapsulates Driver, Monitor, and Sequencer  
- **Driver**: Drives APB signals to the DUT according to sequences  
- **Monitor**: Observes DUT signals and collects transaction data  
- **Sequencer**: Generates sequences of APB transactions (read/write)  
- **Scoreboard**: Compares DUT outputs with expected results to ensure correctness  
- **Subscriber**: Functional coverage points to verify stimulus completeness
- **Env**: Encapsulates Agent, Agent_config, Scoreboard, and Subscriber  
 




---

## Agent Configuration and UVM Package

To facilitate ease of use and scalability, the environment employs an **`agent_config`** configuration class that centralizes agent parameters and settings. This approach allows easy modification of agent behavior without changing multiple files.

Additionally, all UVM related classes and components are bundled inside a dedicated **package file (`uvm_apb_ram_pkg.sv`)**, which contains all the necessary UVM classes (driver, monitor, sequencer, agent, environment, scoreboard, coverage models). This packaging promotes modularity, reusability, and clean integration in different projects.

## Features

- Fully parameterized UVM agent for APB protocol  
- Multiple test scenarios including random and directed sequences  
- Automated scoreboard checking  
- Functional coverage collection with coverage reports  
- Error injection tests for protocol compliance  
- Support for debug and waveform generation

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Compile** the RTL and testbench:
   ```bash
   vsim +access+r;
    run -all;
    acdb save;
    acdb report -db fcover.acdb -txt -o coverage_data.txt;
    exit
   ```
   

2. **Run Simulation**:

```

## Coverage and Reporting

- Functional coverage points track all valid read/write operations and address ranges  
- Scoreboard reports mismatches with detailed logs  
- Coverage reports generated in HTML format for easy analysis  
- Waveforms can be generated for debugging purposes
